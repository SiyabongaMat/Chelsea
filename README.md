# Chelsea
FanPage
* This project is meant for the user to view information about Chelsea FC, both images and articles and also have an option to save the images and articles in the website to a webpage designated for saves done by the user.

* Basically the user either saves an article or an image. There is a dedicated button to saving articles and the user is able to save image by clicking on the image. After deciding on which article/image the user wants to save, an alert will be displayed by webpage to the user with the numer of articles/images saved in localstorage. Thereafter the user can click on the **saves** link in the navbar. Inversely the user can go to the **saves** page and if there is no image/article saved in localstorage, the webpage will alert that there is no saves made to the localstorage.

# Download process
Download the zipfile with all the files in this repository. Click the green `code` button in the top-right corner.

# How to _use_ the code

* 1. To install this code into your device, make sure that visual studio code is installed and/or any other alternative you may prefer but I strongly recommend visual studio code as it has the **Live Sass compiler** which is very key to the styling of this website. Next download the files in this repository and open its contents which I am sure will be set to visual studio code by _default_.

* **Note: Be sure to check the file directory, but I am sure the code for the file path which be suited for whichever file it is placed in, but never be too sure.**

* 2. In the visual studio code, click the extensions icon (looks like a building clock). From extensions store download the `**Live Sass compiler**`. 

* 3. Go to your browser and download the `**Node.js**` application - meant for debugging the javascript code. Go to your visual studio code thereafter and install `node.js` in the extensions store and give the code a quick run to see if there are any errors_. However when you click the debug icon on the left hand side in the visual studio code screen make sure that the debug option is _node.js_ and not the _node.js(legacy)_ option.

* 4. Next click on the _index.html_ file and if the default app to open the file in is not your default browser, change it to your default browser and **Voila**, the home page should be immediately displayed with information about ChelseaFC.
